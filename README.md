# Hand-written-digit-summation
Given an image with 2 distorted digits ( taken from the MNIST dataset ) find the sum of the two digits.

Uses Some basic image processing techniques as well as a convolutional neural network to predict the sum contained within the image. 
conv.py creates the convolutional neural network by creating instances of other layers(connected or convolutional) and connecting them. Different sizes of networks can be tested by altering this file.
